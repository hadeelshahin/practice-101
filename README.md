Project Scope:
Constructor Function:

*Develop a constructor function (e.g., Person) that acts as a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties. This function will facilitate the instantiation of objects conforming to a predefined structure.
Object Instantiation with new Keyword:

*Demonstrate the process of creating objects by employing the constructor function alongside the new keyword. This mechanism involves the creation of an empty object, with the this keyword within the constructor referring to the newly created object.
Prototypes and Inheritance:

(Highlight the association of every JavaScript object with a prototype. Explore how prototypes serve as fallbacks, allowing the interpreter to traverse the prototype chain when searching for properties or methods.

Notes:

In JavaScript, being a prototype-based language means that it relies on prototypes for inheritance and object creation.
JavaScript uses a prototype chain to establish relationships between objects.
Relationship Between Constructor and Prototype:

Emphasize that the relationship between the constructor function and its prototype is established automatically when you use the new keyword to create an instance. Objects created by the same constructor function share the same prototype, allowing for a more memory-efficient and prototype-based inheritance model in JavaScript.

Additional Note:

The relationship between the constructor function and its prototype is crucial for achieving a streamlined and memory-efficient inheritance structure.
Distinction between __proto__ and prototype:

Clarify the difference between someObject.__proto__ (used to directly access an object's prototype) and someFunction.prototype (associated with instances created by a constructor).
Object Creation using Object.create:

Illustrate the practical application of Object.create for generating objects with a specified prototype. This method offers an alternative approach to object instantiation.


*Summary:
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of prototypes and constructor functions in JavaScript, shedding light on the intricacies of prototype-based inheritance. By delving into the distinctions between __proto__ and prototype and demonstrating the use of Object.create, participants will gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript's unique approach to object-oriented programming.
